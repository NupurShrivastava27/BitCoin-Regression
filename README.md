**BitCoin-Regression using R**
Introduction:
	In 2008, an unknown programmer using the pseudo name of Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a document called Bitcoin: 
  A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital crypto-currency system, 
  meaning the transfer of funds are operated independently of a central bank through the internet. Most notably, 
  these transactions occur with anonymity. 
  Bitcoin has shown significant market capitalization growth in last few years. It is important to understand what 
  drives the fluctuations of the Bitcoin exchange price and to what extent they are predictable.   The graphical representation
  in [https://github.com/NupurShrivastava27/BitCoin-Regression/issues/1] resemble the blue print of a roller coaster more than a financial asset.
